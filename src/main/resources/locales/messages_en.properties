info.water=*Tips for maintaining water-salt balance:*\n\
• Drink clean water\n\
• Drink according to thirst sensation\n\
• Shift the balance towards increasing potassium while normalizing sodium intake\n\
• Replenish water and electrolyte loss after consuming alcohol and caffeine, as well as after workouts and during colds\n\
\n\
*Signs of dehydration:*\n\
• Thirst\n\
• Reduced urine output and its dark yellow color\n\
• Dry mucous membranes\n\
• Mild fatigue, decreased concentration\n\
• Constipation\n\
\n\
*Signs of water excess (overhydration):*\n\
• Frequent and abundant urination with transparent, almost colorless urine\n\
• Mild swelling (edema)\n\
• General weakness, lethargy

info.calories=*Information about calculating food calorie content:*\n\
Calorie content (energy value) of a product is the amount of energy the body will receive from its complete assimilation. To calculate a product's calorie content, the energy value of each nutrient (protein, fat, and carbohydrates) is computed.\n\
\n\
In practice, not all nutrients are fully absorbed during digestion. Nutrient absorption is influenced by:\n\
• Method and degree of food processing\n\
• Food temperature\n\
• Individual health status and digestive characteristics\n\
\n\
If your goal is weight change, enter your target weight in the parameters and run the calculation.

info.macros=Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates (PFC) are the main sources of energy and building materials for the body. They are macronutrients, and their daily intake is measured in grams.\n\
\n\
WHO recommendations (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet):\n\
• Fats should account for no more than 30% of total energy from macronutrients, with saturated fats less than 10% and trans-fats less than 1%\n\
• Sugars should provide no more than 10% of total energy (ideally less than 5%)\n\
• It is recommended to eat at least 400 grams of vegetables daily to meet fiber requirements
info.sodium=*Sodium Intake*\n\
\n\
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily sodium intake of less than 2000 mg (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sodium-reduction), which is equivalent to about 5 g of table salt (approximately one teaspoon). However, the global average intake is around 4310 mg per day—more than double the recommended limit. Excessive sodium consumption is linked to high blood pressure, obesity, kidney disease, and other health issues.\n\
\n\
Recommended daily sodium intake for specific groups: (https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002415.htm)\n\
• Infants under 6 months: 110 mg\n\
• Infants 6–12 months: 370 mg\n\
• Children 1–3 years: 800 mg\n\
• Children 4–8 years: 1000 mg\n\
• Children and teens 9–13 years: 1200 mg\n\
• Teens 14–18 years: 1500 mg\n\
• Adults with high blood pressure: no more than 1500 mg\n\
\n\
If you have high blood pressure, consider increasing your intake of potassium, magnesium, and calcium through your diet.

⚠️ Important: Vegetarians require 1.8 times higher recommendations as non-heme iron from plant sources is less bioavailable.\n\
🥩 Heme vs non-heme iron\n\
• Heme iron:\n - Found in meat, fish and poultry\n - Higher bioavailability (14-18%)\n - Absorption is less affected by other substances\n\
• Non-heme iron:\n - Found in plants and fortified foods\n - Lower bioavailability (5\-12% in vegetarian diets)\n - Absorption highly depends on other substances\n\
\n\
⚖️ Effects of other substances on iron absorption\n\
✅ Enhance absorption:\n\
- Vitamin C\n\
- Meat, poultry and seafood (increase non-heme iron absorption)\n\
❌ Reduce absorption:\n\
- Phytates \(in grains and legumes\)\n\
- Polyphenols \(in some plant foods\)\n\
- Calcium (reduces absorption of both heme and non-heme iron)\n\
  \n\
⚠️ Groups at risk of iron deficiency:\n\
- Pregnant women\n\
- Infants and young children\n\
- Women with heavy menstrual bleeding\n\
- Blood donors\n\
- People with cancer\n\
- People with gastrointestinal disorders\n\
- People with heart failure

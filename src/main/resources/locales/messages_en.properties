info.water=*Tips for maintaining water-salt balance:*\n\
• Drink clean water\n\
• Drink according to thirst sensation\n\
• Shift the balance towards increasing potassium while normalizing sodium intake\n\
• Replenish water and electrolyte loss after consuming alcohol and caffeine, as well as after workouts and during colds\n\
\n\
*Signs of dehydration:*\n\
• Thirst\n\
• Reduced urine output and its dark yellow color\n\
• Dry mucous membranes\n\
• Mild fatigue, decreased concentration\n\
• Constipation\n\
\n\
*Signs of water excess (overhydration):*\n\
• Frequent and abundant urination with transparent, almost colorless urine\n\
• Mild swelling (edema)\n\
• General weakness, lethargy

info.calories=*Information about calculating food calorie content:*\n\
Calorie content (energy value) of a product is the amount of energy the body will receive from its complete assimilation. To calculate a product's calorie content, the energy value of each nutrient (protein, fat, and carbohydrates) is computed.\n\
\n\
In practice, not all nutrients are fully absorbed during digestion. Nutrient absorption is influenced by:\n\
• Method and degree of food processing\n\
• Food temperature\n\
• Individual health status and digestive characteristics\n\
\n\
If your goal is weight change, enter your target weight in the parameters and run the calculation.

info.macros=Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates (PFC) are the main sources of energy and building materials for the body. They are macronutrients, and their daily intake is measured in grams.\n\
\n\
WHO recommendations (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet):\n\
• Fats should account for no more than 30% of total energy from macronutrients, with saturated fats less than 10% and trans-fats less than 1%\n\
• Sugars should provide no more than 10% of total energy (ideally less than 5%)\n\
• It is recommended to eat at least 400 grams of vegetables daily to meet fiber requirements
